# ailook on Tinker Edge T (TET)

This project is about cars plates recognition. The following content concerns setting it up on a Tinker Edge T board.

## Install Tinker Edge T Software

To Incorporate the Tinker edge T environment (software) itâ€™s important to go to the following forum URL to download it:

 https://tinker-board.asus.com/forum/index.php?/forum/5-software/

Then we need to unpackage it, Install the driver `android_winusb.inf` locate on:

```
Tinker_Edge_T-Mendel-Eagle-V3.0 2-20201015\tools\ASUS_Android_USB_drivers_for_Windows\Windows_XP_VISTA_7_8_8.1\Android
```

when the above is finished, we have to connect our PC to Tinker Edge T (with USB-C) and execute `flash.cmd` on windows or `flash.sh` on Linux.

### Configure SSH into Tinker Edge T

It's important to maintain the connection between the PC  and TET. So we are going to continue with installing:


```
py -m pip install --user mendel-development-tool
```

This allows us to SSH into TET:

```
mdt devices
mdt shell
```
